    <h2>About WForc</h2>
    <p>
        WForc is an app that was designed as a challange to test my html, css and java script knowledge and experience
        By making it entirly using vanilla javascript and css and implementing technologies like spa and pwa without
        using
        any javascript frameworks and by making this app feature complete with multilingul support geolocation api and
        even
        error handling plus a focus on speed, seo, browser compatiblity and Accesability
        handling i've ensured this app isn't just another throw away weather app but a real world product
    </p>
    <h3>Thank you for using WForc <br>
        sencerly, Mohamed
    </h3>
